                  In this project, a Task Manager is built using React JS,
                  Firebase authentication, SpringBoot and PostgreSQL. This App
                  helps users to manage their tasks by allowing them to set time
                  constraints in achieving the goals and keeps them away from
                  any distractions and increases the productivity. All tasks are
                  stored in a PostgreSQL database and are synced in real time
                  with our react application. I have deployed the application
                  using Aws EC2 Linux virtual machine, with the help of Docker.

                  all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained
                  score for the turn if they roll a 1 and switching the player.
                  If they wish they can also hold their turnâ€™s score, which in
                  turn adds to the original score and switches the player.The
                  player who meets the desired score constraint first wins the
                  game.
